### 5. Drag-and-Drop Interface

**Challenge:**  
Create a simple drag-and-drop interface where users can reorder a list of items.

#### Discussion Points:

1. **Third-Party Library vs. Custom Implementation**  
    - Would you use a third-party library (e.g., `react-beautiful-dnd`, `react-dnd`) or implement it from scratch?  
    - Justify your choice.

2. **Core Drag Events**  
    - If implementing from scratch, how would you handle the core drag events (`onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDrop`)?

3. **State Management**  
    - How would you manage the state to reflect the reordered list?

4. **Accessibility Considerations**  
    - Discuss accessibility considerations for drag-and-drop interfaces.

5. **Handling Multiple Lists**  
    - How would you handle dragging items between different lists or containers?
