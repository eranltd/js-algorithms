# Payment Flow Architecture

This document outlines the current payment processing flow, its drawbacks, and a proposed improved architecture using a message queue.

## Current Flow

The current implementation uses a synchronous, blocking flow managed by a BFF (Backend for Frontend).

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant BFF
    participant Udi Service
    participant Billing Gates Service
    participant SaaS App

    Frontend->>+BFF: 1. Commit Payment
    BFF->>+Udi Service: a. Create Order (confirmed=false)
    Udi Service-->>-BFF: Order ID
    BFF->>+Billing Gates Service: b. Charge User
    Billing Gates Service-->>-BFF: Payment Success
    BFF->>+Udi Service: c. Confirm Order
    Udi Service-->>-BFF: d. SSO Token
    BFF-->>-Frontend: Redirect to SaaS App with SSO Token
    Frontend->>SaaS App: Auto-login with SSO Token
```

## Drawbacks of the Current Method

The current synchronous approach presents several critical issues:

- **Poor User Experience ðŸ˜«:** The user is blocked and must wait for all four backend steps to complete. Any service delay results in a slow and frustrating experience.

- **High Coupling:** The BFF is tightly coupled to the Udi and Billing services. If either service fails or is slow, the entire payment process fails, making the system brittle.

- **Lack of Fault Tolerance:** The system can be left in an inconsistent state if any step fails. For example, a user could be charged without having their order confirmed, requiring complex manual recovery.

- **Scalability Issues:** The synchronous, long-running requests make the BFF a bottleneck, limiting the system's ability to handle a high volume of concurrent payments.

## Improved Flow using a Message Queue (Kafka)

By adopting an asynchronous, event-driven architecture, we can decouple our services, improve user experience, and increase resilience.

### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant BFF
    participant Kafka
    participant Billing Service (Consumer)
    participant Order Service (Consumer)

     Frontend->>+BFF: 1. Commit Payment
     BFF->>+Kafka: 2. Publish 'PaymentInitiated' event
     BFF-->>-Frontend: 3. Acknowledge Payment & Redirect
     Frontend->>SaaS App: (Shows "Processing" or similar status)

     par
         Billing Service->>+Kafka: Consume 'PaymentInitiated'
         Billing Service->>Billing Gates: Charge User
         Billing Service->>+Kafka: Publish 'PaymentSucceeded' event
     and
         Order Service->>+Kafka: Consume 'PaymentSucceeded'
         Order Service->>Udi Service: Create & Confirm Order
         Order Service->>Udi Service: Get SSO Token
         Order Service->>+Kafka: Publish 'OrderConfirmed' event (with SSO Token)
     end
```

## Advantages of the Improved Method

The proposed event-driven architecture offers significant benefits:

- **Improved User Experience âœ¨:** The user gets an immediate response from the BFF. They are no longer forced to wait and can be redirected to a page showing the "processing" status.

- **Increased Resilience:** If a downstream service (like Billing) is down, the event remains in the Kafka queue to be processed when the service recovers. This prevents data loss and inconsistent states.

- **Enhanced Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on load. If payment processing is slow, you can add more Billing Service consumers without touching the BFF or other parts of the system.

- **Loose Coupling:** The BFF's only responsibility is to publish an event. It doesn't need to know about the complex orchestration of billing and order confirmation, making the system more modular and easier to maintain.
