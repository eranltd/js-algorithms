# E-commerce Platform: System Architecture Explained

This document outlines the components and data flows of an e-commerce platform, based on the provided architecture diagram. The system is designed with a modern, microservices-oriented approach, leveraging serverless hosting, third-party integrations, and a clear separation of concerns.

## 1. User Purchase Funnel

The primary user journey for making a purchase follows these steps:

1.  **Initiate Purchase:** The user interacts with the frontend application, providing their credit card details. The frontend securely converts this information into a `paymentToken` via a service like Stripe's client-side library.
2.  **Billing & Payment:** The `paymentToken` is sent to the backend's **Billing Gates** microservice. This service is responsible for orchestrating payments with various providers (e.g., charging `PayPal`, `Stripe`, `Braintree`).
3.  **User Registration:** Upon successful payment, the **User Directory** microservice registers the user's account, a process referred to as "standardization (confirm)."
4.  **Redirect:** The user is redirected back to the main product page or a confirmation screen, completing the funnel.

## 2. System Components

### A. Frontend Layer (Hosted on Vercel)

*   **Technology Stack:** The primary user-facing application is a **Hosted Online Cart** built with `Next.js` + `React`. It is deployed on `Vercel`, leveraging its Edge Network for performance.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Cart:** Manages the user's shopping cart state.
    *   **Purchase | trial:** The UI component that handles the checkout process.
    *   **Backend for Frontend (BFF):** A dedicated backend layer that serves the frontend application. It acts as an intermediary between the cart UI and the main backend microservices.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:**
    *   **Sentry.js:** Integrated for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.
    *   **MixPanel:** Used for product analytics to track user interactions and funnel conversions.
*   **Security:**
    *   **Endpoint Protection:** A service that sits in front of the hosted application, likely providing WAF (Web Application Firewall) and bot protection.

### B. Backend Layer (UCL Microservices)

This is the core of the system, composed of several independent microservices.

*   **Billing Gates:** Handles all payment-related logic. It integrates directly with third-party payment processors like `Stripe` to process transactions.
*   **User Directory:** Manages all user data, including profiles, authentication, and subscription status. It is the source of truth for user information.
*   **CronJobRunner:** A dedicated service for running scheduled tasks, such as subscription renewals, sending summary emails, or data cleanup routines.

### C. Database & Data Stores

*   **Primary DB:** A central database, likely a relational database like `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL`, that stores critical business data.
*   **Schemas:** Contains tables for `order` and `subscription` data.
*   **Management:** The database is managed by a dedicated team (`devops`, `chester`).

### D. DevOps & Operations

*   **API Gateway / Load Balancer:** All external traffic to the DevOps-managed services passes through a central API Gateway. This is responsible for routing, rate limiting, and authentication.
*   **DevOps Section:** A separate cluster of services for business intelligence or data processing (`BIG`). These services appear to be consumers of data from the main microservices cluster.
*   **Logging:** `Coralogix` is used as a centralized logging solution, aggregating logs from various services for monitoring and debugging.
*   **Resilience:** An exponential backoff mechanism is implemented for communication between the DevOps services and the UCL Microservices, ensuring that retries after a failure don't overwhelm the system.

### E. Marketing & Ancillary Services

*   **Marketing Funnel, QUIZZ:** A separate application or service designed to attract and engage potential customers, likely feeding leads into the main application.
*   **Main Application:** A broader application context that the e-commerce cart is a part of.
