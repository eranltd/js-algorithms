# Infinite Scroll with Virtualization & Performance Optimization

## Challenge

Implement an infinite scrolling list of items. 

### Requirements:
- As the user scrolls down, more items should load dynamically.
- To handle a very large number of items (e.g., thousands), optimize performance by implementing **list virtualization** (also known as windowing).

### Key Features:
- Render only the visible items within the viewport.
- Include a small buffer of items just outside the viewport for smooth scrolling.

### Goal:
Achieve a seamless and efficient infinite scrolling experience for users.
